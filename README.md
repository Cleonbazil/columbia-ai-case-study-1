# $${\color{blue}AI\space on\space BMS}$$ 
*This project explores the implementation of Artificial Intellillenge (AI)
 in Building Management Systems (BMS) to optimize energy usage by regulating 
 climate control.*

>To start our journey in the proper path it is best if develop to the 
best of our abalities a clear understanding of what AI and BMS represent in the 
context of this project.

### *What is AI
>'Artificial Intelligence or AI is a technology that enables computers and 
machines to simulate human intelligence and problem solving capabilities.

>On its own or combined with other technologies (e.g., sensors, geolocation, 
robotics) AI can perform tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence 
or intervention. Digital assistants, GPS guidance, autonomous vehicles, and 
generative AI tools (like Open AI's Chat GPT) are just a few examples of AI in 
the daily news and our daily lives.

>As a field of computer science, artificial intelligence encompasses 
(and is often mentioned together with) machine learning and deep learning. 
These disciplines involve the development of AI algorithms, modeled after the 
decision-making processes of the human brain, that can ‘learn’ from available 
data and make increasingly more accurate classifications or predictions over 
time.
