*This project explores the implementation of Artificial Intellillenge (AI)
 in Building Management Systems (BMS) to optimize energy usage by regulating 
 climate control and monitoring equiment performance.*

<strong>*To start our journey in the proper path it is best if develop to the 
best of our abalities a clear understanding of what AI and BMS represent in the 
context of this project.*<strong>

#### *What is AI?*
>'Artificial Intelligence or AI is a technology that enables computers and 
machines to simulate human intelligence and problem solving capabilities.

>On its own or combined with other technologies (e.g., sensors, geolocation, 
robotics) AI can perform tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence 
or intervention. Digital assistants, GPS guidance, autonomous vehicles, and 
generative AI tools (like Open AI's Chat GPT) are just a few examples of AI in 
the daily news and our daily lives.

>As a field of computer science, artificial intelligence encompasses 
(and is often mentioned together with) machine learning and deep learning. 
These disciplines involve the development of AI algorithms, modeled after the 
decision-making processes of the human brain, that can ‘learn’ from available 
data and make increasingly more accurate classifications or predictions over 
time.'

#### *What is BMS?*
>'A Building Management System (BMS), sometimes called a Building Automation 
System (BAS), is a computer-based system installed to control and monitor a 
building's electrical equipment such as ventilation, lighting, energy, fire 
systems, and security systems. It consists of software and hardware.

>A BMS is crucial to managing demand for energy in a cost-effective way and 
essential to all new builds. It allows owners and landlords of buildings to 
reduce energy costs and provide optimum comfort for users, tenants and 
residents of the buildings. It allows remote management of heating, ventilation 
and air conditioning (HVAC) so that maintenance staff do not have to spend time 
visiting each building or room to shut down, switch on or adjust temperature 
levels or air conditioning.

>Because data is consolidated in a single system, a BMS improves reporting and 
information management leading to quality, informed decision-making, better 
performance and a reduction in energy use, thereby saving money.'

*BMS MAGE*

<strong>*Now that our two main characters have a better difined outline we can
direct our attetion to why and how they converged. As stated above AI allows
a system to learn and make decisions, and a BMS cost-effectively manages the 
energy usage of the property through constant monitoring and consequent 
parameter adjustments to minimize it while satisfying the needs of the 
tenants.*<strong>

<strong>*The operating costs of a commercial property in a big city like 
New York are tremendous and avenues to curb their impact on the bottom line are 
always being explored, allowing the BMS to learn how/when energy is used to
optimally modify setpoints accoridingly, detect equiment failure and/or
malfuction, recommend equipment maintenace schedules to avoid performance 
degradation amongst other operational aspects would be a significant step to 
this end, and AI is the tool which affords this ability to the BMS.*<strong>

## Case Study-1 
### *Flex2X* 
>'One of these systems is called “Flex2X”, developed by UK-based company 
Grid Edge. The system works by combining data obtained from a building’s 
existing energy management system with other data sources (for example, on 
weather conditions) and analysing it using artificial intelligence algorithms 
that can optimise the building’s energy use in real time. The algorithms are 
considered “artificially intelligent” because they change based on the data they
receive, a process referred to as “learning”. This allows the software to make 
predictions for the building’s energy use, 24 hours in advance, based on its 
experiences in the past.

>The software is also connected to the electricity meter and the wider 
electricity network. This allows it to monitor the price and generation mix of 
electricity, and decide when to increase or decrease the electricity load of the
building, based on the cost or carbon-intensity of electricity at any given 
time.

>By controlling when the building uses more or less energy, the software converts
the building’s electricity load profile from being more or less a fixed load, 
into a flexible load. Flexible loads are a valuable commodity in today’s energy
markets because they help energy market operators to better manage peaks and 
troughs in demand, and incorporate more intermittent renewable energy sources 
into the grid.'

### *Impact*
>'This technology could potentially realise a number of benefits for a range of 
parties.
>For building occupants, increasing the intelligence of the building management 
system should ensure that comfort is optimised and energy services are available
when needed while energy costs are reduced thanks to reduced wastage. In 
addition, occupants interested in questions such as the sustainability of their 
building’s operations would have access to real-time data on information such as
>the carbon-intensity of the building’s energy supply.

>For building owners/operators, intelligent building management systems like 
Grid Edge offer the opportunity to reduce costs, cut carbon and maximise comfort
through load-shifting and optimisation, as well as recoup the cost of upgrading 
the building, by selling the building’s flexible load on the market. This could 
translate to a greater willingness to invest in sustainability upgrades, knowing 
that the upfront costs of such upgrades could be offset through trading the 
building’s flexible load.

>For grid operators, this technology promises to unlock new, predictable sources 
of flexible demand, which will help in balancing supply and demand, especially 
useful as the share of intermittent renewable sources of energy increases.'

### *Measured benefits include:*

..*Cost savings and revenue generation equivalent to >10% of annual on-site 
energy costs;
..*Carbon reduction through load-shifting and efficiency measures 
(up to 40% has been evidenced).'
