# $${\color{blue}AI\space on\space BMS}$$ 
*This project explores the implementation of Artificial Intellillenge (AI)
 in Building Management Systems (BMS) to optimize energy usage by regulating 
 climate control and monitoring equiment performance.*

<strong>*To start our journey in the proper path it is best if develop to the 
best of our abalities a clear understanding of what AI and BMS represent in the 
context of this project.*<strong>

#### *What is AI?*
>'Artificial Intelligence or AI is a technology that enables computers and 
machines to simulate human intelligence and problem solving capabilities.

>On its own or combined with other technologies (e.g., sensors, geolocation, 
robotics) AI can perform tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence 
or intervention. Digital assistants, GPS guidance, autonomous vehicles, and 
generative AI tools (like Open AI's Chat GPT) are just a few examples of AI in 
the daily news and our daily lives.

>As a field of computer science, artificial intelligence encompasses 
(and is often mentioned together with) machine learning and deep learning. 
These disciplines involve the development of AI algorithms, modeled after the 
decision-making processes of the human brain, that can ‘learn’ from available 
data and make increasingly more accurate classifications or predictions over 
time.'

[1]

#### *What is BMS?*
>'A Building Management System (BMS), sometimes called a Building Automation 
System (BAS), is a computer-based system installed to control and monitor a 
building's electrical equipment such as ventilation, lighting, energy, fire 
systems, and security systems. It consists of software and hardware.

>A BMS is crucial to managing demand for energy in a cost-effective way and 
essential to all new builds. It allows owners and landlords of buildings to 
reduce energy costs and provide optimum comfort for users, tenants and 
residents of the buildings. It allows remote management of heating, ventilation 
and air conditioning (HVAC) so that maintenance staff do not have to spend time 
visiting each building or room to shut down, switch on or adjust temperature 
levels or air conditioning.

>Because data is consolidated in a single system, a BMS improves reporting and 
information management leading to quality, informed decision-making, better 
performance and a reduction in energy use, thereby saving money.'

<strong>*Now that our two main characters have a better difined outline we can
direct our attetion to why and how they converged. As stated above AI allows
a system to learn and make decisions, and a BMS cost-effectively manages the 
energy usage of the property through constant monitoring and consequent 
parameter adjustments to minimize it while satisfying the needs of the 
tenants.*<strong>

<strong>*The operating costs of a commercial property in a big city like
New York or London are tremendous and avenues to curb their impact on the bottom 
line are always being explored, allowing the BMS to learn how/when energy is 
used to optimally modify setpoints accoridingly, detect equiment failure and/or
malfuction, recommend equipment maintenace schedules to avoid performance 
degradation amongst other operational aspects would be a significant step to 
this end, and AI is the tool which affords this ability to the BMS.*<strong>

## The Tech 
### *Flex2X* 
<strong>*“Flex2X” is a system developed by UK-based company Grid Edge. 
The system recieves the data from a property's existing BMS and harnesses AI
to optimize the building’s energy usage . Artificial's intelligence ability to 
learn allows for the system to predict the property's posible energy consumption
patterns up to 24 hours in advance based previous processed data*<strong>

<strong>*The system is linked to the electric grid allowing it to track the price 
and availability of energy in real time, which enables it to adjust the 
property's load based on energy cost or carbon-intensity*<strong>

<strong>*This capability is pivotal in transforming the building's load profile 
from fixed to flexible making a valuable commodity which allows the energy 
markets to better manage the grid's energy demand*<strong>

### *The Benefits*
#### For occupants: 
1. Increased confort whith reduce energy waste
2. Greater energy availability and reduced costs
3. Sustainable building operations

#### For owners:
1. Greater cost reduction opportunities
2. Reduced waste
3. Carbon foot-print reduction
4. Revenue derived from selling the building's flexible load profile 
   in the energy markets

#### Measured benefits include:
1. Cost savings and revenue generation equivalent to >10% of annual on-site 
energy costs.
2. Carbon reduction through load-shifting and efficiency measures 
(up to 40% has been evidenced).

## *The founders*
### Dan Wright:
>Formerly a Research Fellow in Operational Research (OR) at the European 
Bioenergy Research Institute, Dan continues to apply his research in OR and AI 
to buildings increased participation on the grid-edge. His multi-disciplinary 
background in energy and applied mathematics provide a unique insight into the 
opportunities in applying novel methods to support our customers saving cost and 
carbon without compromising on their core operational needs. Dan also led the 
implementation and operation of Grid Edge’s ISO27001 Information Security Mgmt. 
System at Grid Edge.

### Jim Scott:
>Co-lead investigator in ITHECA project and PhD in operational research and 
optimisation methods.Held management position in energy efficiency and 
consultancy business.Thought-leader and expert in Vehicle-to-Grid sector.

### Tom Anderson:
>Driven by a mantra of "change versus more of the same", Tom has spent his 
entire career bringing innovation to the energy sector. As co-founder Tom's 
proudest achievement has been building Grid Edge's family of bright, 
enthusiastic and passionate engineers, data scientists and professionals. Prior 
to co-founding Grid Edge, Tom enjoyed a successful career with the European 
Bioenergy Research Institute.


## The Company
<strong>*Grid Edge was founded in 2017 by Dan Wright, Jim Scott and 
Tom Anderson with a clear mission 'change the way that people use energy'
tranforming costumers from mere consumers to 'active informed and intellingent'
participants in the way tenants use energy by empowering them with the 
necessary information to make better decisions.*<strong>

### How?
>We mine high accuracy data from a building, apply artificial intelligence, and 
to turn it into meaningful, actionable insights to inform comfort, carbon and 
cost decision-making.
